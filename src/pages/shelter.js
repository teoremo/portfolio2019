                <p className="project__article__p">When I joined Shelter, there were few people around me who really had a clear idea of what a Service Designer is. <br />To familiarise myself with Shelter services and identify opportunities, I began conducting contextual user research. <strong>I learned how complex it is to engage with vulnerable people, from &lsquo;recruiting&rsquo; to actually carring out research activities with somebody who is or will soon be homeless.</strong> Reading existing bibliography and reviewing in-depth analysis produced by our researchers proved useful. That&rsquo;s when I started mapping things. <br /><br />By developing a system map at Shelter, I was able to &lsquo;connect the dots&rsquo; and find areas for improvement accross different areas of the organisation.<br />Designing a user journey map helped to visualise what an ideal experience could look like for a person seeking advice from Shelter and communicate that idea quickly to get feedback.</p>
